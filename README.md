# SSIM
## Introduction
* Implementation of SSIM(Structural Similarity Index)
* Use boxfilter for average operation, for sample image 101.jpg's result(result = 0.903216), it's close to MATLAB(result = 0.8768). Gaussian way for average operation is also provided, the result will be more close to MATLAB result.

* Input: Color image, Output: SSIM result
